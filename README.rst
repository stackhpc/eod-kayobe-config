Kayobe Configuration
====================

Kayobe configuration for the Evolution of Darwin system in the University of
Cambridge's High Performance Computing Service (HPCS).

Overview
========

This repository provides configuration for the `kayobe
<https://github.com/stackhpc/kayobe>`_ project. It is intended to encourage
version control of site configuration.

Kayobe is an open source tool for automating deployment of Scientific OpenStack
onto a set of bare metal servers.  Kayobe is composed of Ansible playbooks, a
python module, and makes heavy use of the OpenStack kolla project.  Kayobe aims
to complement the kolla-ansible project, providing an opinionated yet highly
configurable OpenStack deployment and automation of many operational
procedures.
