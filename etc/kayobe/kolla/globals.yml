# defaults to UUID.  This setting overrides K-A and brings it in-line with
# Keystone's default.

# NOTE: We are increasing the HAProxy timeouts to 5 minutes due to the neutron
# generic switch driver, which synchronously applies switch configuration for
# each ironic port during node provisioning and tear down. Due to the lack of
# batching of configuration sets, and the long time required for configuration
# to be applied to the Dell switches (~20 seconds), concurrent deployment of
# multiple nodes can cause configuration transactions to back up.  The specific
# API calls that require this long timeout are:
# - Creation and deletion of VLAN networks.
# - Creation or update of ports, adding binding information.
# - Update of ports, removing binding information.
# - Deletion of ports.
